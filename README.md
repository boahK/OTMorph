## Installation
To test the proposed OTMorph, we may need Conda environment. You can download Anaconda from this [link](https://www.anaconda.com/download).
Then, please run:
```
conda env create â€“f OTMorph.yml
```

## Train

To train our model, run this command:

```train
sh ./scripts/train.sh
```

## Test

To test the trained our model, run:

```eval
sh ./scripts/test.sh
```

When you run the code, "./results" folder is generated. And the registration results are saved in this directory.
